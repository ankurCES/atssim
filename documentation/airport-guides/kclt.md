### About this facility
Charlotte-Douglas International Airport, Charlotte, NC

CLT is currently a hub for American Airlines. It has three north-south parallel runways and one crosswind runway. In 2017, CLT was the seventh (7th) busiest airport in the world by number of aircraft movements. 

### Airspace
The airspace surrounding CLT (Class B) is highly complex, with the CLT TRACON owning multiple areas from the surface up to 16,000 ft.

### Instrument Procedures
CLT is served by a large number of RNAV and conventional SIDS and STARS. Although these procedures — especially the arrivals — are highly automated, they do still require radar vectors to and from the runway.
