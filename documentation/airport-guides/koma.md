# KOMA - Omaha Eppley / R90 Omaha TRACON

## About MDO
Eppley Airfield (IATA: OMA, ICAO: KOMA, FAA LID: OMA) is an airport in the midwestern United States, located three miles (5 km) northeast of downtown Omaha, Nebraska. On the west bank of the Missouri River in Douglas County, it is the largest airport in Nebraska, and is classified as a medium hub airport by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). It is owned and operated by the Omaha Airport Authority (OAA).(Wikipedia)

## Airspace
The R90 TRACON airspace is fairly large and covers multiple smaller airports from the surface to 15,000'.

## Procedures
OMA is served primarily by conventional SIDs and STARs. The published SIDs require radar vectors to the first fix, while aircraft on the STARs will require radar vectors to the final approach course. At the time of publication (early 2022), two RNAV STARs have been published and included in the simulator. This will be updated if-and-when more RNAV procedures are published.

Although both SIDs (BLUFS4 and CATTL3) have departures assigned to runway heading, the following headings are recommended based on the SOP documents below. 

| SID    | North Flow (32L/R & 36) | South Flow (14L/R & 18) |
|--------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| BLUFS4 | 360°                    | 140°                    |
| CATTL3 | 320°                    | 180°                    |
