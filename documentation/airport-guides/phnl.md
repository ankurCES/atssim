## Airspace
The HNL TRACON airspace is fairly large and covers multiple smaller airports on the island of Oahu from the surface to 15,000'.

## Procedures
HNL is served by a mix of conventional and RNAV departure and arrival procedures. In conventional SIDs, aircraft are already programmed to make the following turns upon departure:

| Runway          | Heading              |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| 4 L/R           | 150°                 | 
| 8 L/R           | 150°                 |
| 22 L/R          | 180°                 |
| 26 L/R          | 180°                 |

RNAV SIDs (BANZI1 and PIPLN1), are RNAV-off-the-ground for the initial climb, but then require radar vectors to the first fix.
