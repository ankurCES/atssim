# KRIC - Richmond International Airport

## About RIC
Richmond International Airport (IATA: RIC, ICAO: KRIC, FAA LID: RIC) is a joint civil-military airport in Sandston, Virginia, United States, an unincorporated community (in Henrico County). The airport is about 7 miles (11 km) southeast of downtown Richmond, the capital of the Commonwealth of Virginia. Richmond International Airport is the busiest airport in central Virginia and the third-busiest in the state behind Washington D.C.'s two major airports, Washington Dulles and Washington National. RIC covers 2,500 acres (1,012 ha) of land.(Wikipedia)

## Airspace - Potomac Tracon (James River / JRV Area)
The PCT JRV sector extends from the surface to 12,000ft in most areas. For the purposes of Richmond, only the FLTRK ("Flat Rock") and TAPPA sectors are available. These sectors extend roughly 35 nautical miles in each direction from the airport. Within these sectors, there are a number of Restricted Areas and Military Operations Areas that aircraft must avoid. 

## Procedures
RIC has two conventional SIDs, two RNAV SIDs, and three RNAV STARs. All four SIDs are "off-the-ground" and require little ATC input. The STARs are mostly automated, but require radar vectors to final after reaching the last fix. As in the real world, turbojet aircraft arriving from north and east of the field are routed from JAMIE directly to the airport. The airspace also has a significant number of Victor airways.
