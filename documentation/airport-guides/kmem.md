# KMEM - Memphis International Airport

## About MEM
Memphis International Airport (IATA: MEM, ICAO: KMEM, FAA LID: MEM) is a civil-military airport located seven miles (11 km) southeast of Downtown Memphis in Shelby County, Tennessee, United States. MEM is the primary international airport serving Memphis, Tennessee, United States. It covers 3,900 acres (1,600 ha) and has four runways.

It is home to the FedEx Express global hub, often referred to as the FedEx Superhub or simply the Superhub, which processes many of the company's packages. Non-stop FedEx destinations from Memphis include cities across the continental United States, Canada, Europe, the Middle East, Asia and South America. From 1993 to 2009, Memphis had the largest cargo operations of any airport worldwide. MEM dropped to the second position in 2010, just behind Hong Kong. It still remained the busiest cargo airport in the United States and in the Western Hemisphere, until 2020, when it once again became the world's busiest cargo handling airport due to the surge in ecommerce partly caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The airport was also a passenger hub for Republic Airlines, which became Northwest Airlines, and continued as a hub when Northwest merged into Delta Air Lines, from 1985 to 2013.

On the passenger side, MEM averages over 80 passenger flights per day. The 164th Airlift Wing of the Tennessee Air National Guard is based at the co-located Memphis Air National Guard Base, operating C-17 Globemaster III transport aircraft. (Wikipedia)

## Airspace - Memphis TRACON (M03)
The M03 airspace sector extends from the surface to 16,000ft with a roughly 40 nautical mile radius from the MEM VOR. Due to the high levels of FedEx traffic, MEM has a Class B airspace.

## Procedures
MEM has a significant number of RNAV and conventional procedures. All RNAV SIDs are RNAV off-the-ground, and RNAV STARs are highly automated, requiring only vectors to the final approach course. A few of these SIDs (AUTMN6, GENEH7, GMBUD7, and NIKEI5) are only useable from 0200L-0600L, due to their consistent conflict with arriving aircraft. For this reason, no aircraft will be automatically assigned these departures (although the user retains the ability to reroute them as necessary). The sim is currently set up for a SOUTH flow. The following runway assignments are recommended for departures:

| Runway | Departures |
|--------|------------|
| 18L    | AZONE, BBKNG, CRSON, GENEH, GMBUD, GOETZ, SELPH |
| 18C    | AUTMN, BINKY, CHLDR, DUCKZ, GRRIZ, HOTRD, JTEEE, NIKEI, OLEMS, PIEPE, ZUMIT |
